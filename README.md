# Credit Risk Modeling

How do financial firms make a decision on applications for credit cards or loans? In this project I will explore how to apply machine learning techniques to reduce risk and ensure profitability. I will use data sets that emulate real credit applications while focusing on business value.

For this project I trained and tuned the following models:

- Logistic Regression Model
- XGBoost
- Neural Network

### Results:

<b>Logistic Regression</b>:

              precision    recall  f1-score   support

 Non-Default       0.90      0.76      0.82      9177
     Default       0.45      0.69      0.55      2609
