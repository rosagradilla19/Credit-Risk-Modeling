# Credit Risk Modeling

How do financial firms make a decision on applications for credit cards or loans? In this project I will explore how to apply machine learning techniques to reduce risk and ensure profitability. I will use data sets that emulate real credit applications while focusing on business value.

For this project I trained and tuned the following models:

- Logistic Regression Model
- XGBoost
- Neural Network

### Results:

<b>Logistic Regression</b>:
        
|   	       | Precision 	| Recall	|  F1score |
|:----------:|:----------:|:-------:|:--------:|
|Non-Default |      0.90	|   	0.76|   	0.82 | 
|Default     |      0.45	|   	0.69|   	0.55 |


The EDA notebook contains the details regarding exploration of the data as well as cleaning it.
